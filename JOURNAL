   Found a bug:
    this crashes when current_track_payload is NULL; sds doesn't allocate a new string
    when a NULL reference is passed in.
    sdscpy( data->current_track_payload, s );
   fixed the underlying sdscpylen() method to allocate a string if NULL is passed in

 TODO:
 - Test websockets work, we should be able to run:
   python tools/test_websocket.py
   - it should first print out {"type": "welcome"}
   - it should then send a {"type": "ping"} to the server, then it should wait for a pong



 - TODO: get this working:
   curl localhost/playlists | jq .
   - need a way to display all playlists
   - need a way to post a new playlist (all in one go -- dont worry about posting just deltas)
     - when a playlist is changed, we'll just create a version number based on the time
       - this will be used while pushing "now playing" messages via websockets, so we don't
         have to refresh the playlist all the time

 Whenever a song changes, we need to push a message: '{ "playing": true, "song_id": 4, "playlist_ver": 999 }'
 The playlist ver will be a number identifying the current playlist.
 a playlist in this context is actually a set of playlists. e.g.
 {
    version: 999,
    playlists: [
        {
            name: quick_album,
            items: [
               { artist: foo, song: bar, album: blah, path: /home/...},  # song id 0
               { artist: foo, song: bar, album: blah, path: /home/...},  # song id 1
               { artist: foo, song: bar, album: blah, path: /home/...},  # song id 2
            ]
        },
        {
            name: otherplaylist,
            items: [
               { artist: foo, song: bar, album: blah, path: /home/...},  # song id 3
               { artist: foo, song: bar, album: blah, path: /home/...},  # song id 4
               { artist: foo, song: bar, album: blah, path: /home/...},  # song id 5
            ]
        },
    ],
 ]

 the playlist will have the path from the /library endpoint

 TODO: implement a POST /playlist to reload the playlist, and similarly a GET /playlist to retrieve it

2017-11-03
 wrote tools/post_playlist.py to test sending playlists
 the fetch can be tested with: curl localhost/playlists | jq .

 when posting a playlist, it freezes up; posting an empty playlist works. <-- this only happened once, seems like an intermittent problem

 after doing an empty post, restarting the server caused a crash (it tried playing the first file of an empty playlist)

 I can now play music.

 TODO:
  - enable id3 caching
  - enable playing streams

 start server with:

make clean && make
WEB_ROOT=/home/alex/gh/alexcb/raspberrypimusic/resources/web/ sudo -E ./my123 ~/music streams playlists
python tools/test_websocket.py
python tools/post_playlist.py

 start websocket streamer with:

TODO:
 - [done] change playlist to reference "track" struct instead of playlist_item -- this is to avoid storing id3 tags in multiple areas


Running on the pi:

cd ~/mpg123hack/
git fetch && git checkout origin/master && make clean && make
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG WEB_ROOT=/home/alex/mpg123hack/resources/web/ sudo -E ./my123 /media/nugget_share/music/alex-beet/ streams playlists /home/alex/id3_cache

Running locally with all music:

make clean && make
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG WEB_ROOT=/home/alex/gh/alexcb/raspberrypimusic/resources/web/ sudo -E ./my123 /media/nugget_share/music/alex-beet/ streams playlists alex-beet-cache

or running with local music

LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG WEB_ROOT=/home/alex/gh/alexcb/raspberrypimusic/resources/web/ sudo -E ./my123 ~/music streams playlists-local local-music-cache


Then change the playlist with:
./tools/ncurses-interface/go.py

sudo gdb ./my123 -ex 'handle SIGPIPE nostop noprint pass' -ex 'run ~/music streams playlists local-music-cache'

updating libmpg123 on raspberrypi:
mkdir ~/mpg123_src
cd ~/mpg123_src
wget 'https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mpg123/mpg123/1.25.6/mpg123-1.25.6.tar.bz2?r=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fmpg123%2Ffiles%2F&ts=1514839666&use_mirror=newcontinuum'
tar xvjf mpg123.tar.bz2
cd mpg123-1.25.6
./configure
make
sudo make install
