   Found a bug:
    this crashes when current_track_payload is NULL; sds doesn't allocate a new string
    when a NULL reference is passed in.
    sdscpy( data->current_track_payload, s );
   fixed the underlying sdscpylen() method to allocate a string if NULL is passed in

 TODO:
 - Test websockets work, we should be able to run:
   python tools/test_websocket.py
   - it should first print out {"type": "welcome"}
   - it should then send a {"type": "ping"} to the server, then it should wait for a pong



 - TODO: get this working:
   curl localhost/playlists | jq .
   - need a way to display all playlists
   - need a way to post a new playlist (all in one go -- dont worry about posting just deltas)
     - when a playlist is changed, we'll just create a version number based on the time
       - this will be used while pushing "now playing" messages via websockets, so we don't
         have to refresh the playlist all the time
